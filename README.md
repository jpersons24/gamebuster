# gamebuster

Gamebuster is a mock e-commerce site inspired by the combination of Blockbuster and Gamefly.

Gamebuster was built using React with Hooks front end and Ruby on Rails backend.

Using Gamebuster:
1. Clone both the front end repository and back end repository.
2. Navigating into the front end repository, run the command 'npm install' from your command line. Once finsihed, you can run the command 'npm start' to get the front end server up and running.
3. Navigating into the back end repository, run the command 'rails s -p 4000'. This will start the back end server.
5. Once both servers are up and running, you can create an account or sign into an existing account, where you will then be able to 'rent' video games listed on the site for a set amount of time.
6. If you need more money to rent the games of your choosing, you have the ability to increase the amount of money in your 'wallet'.
7. Happy gaming!
