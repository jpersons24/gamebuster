# GameBuster

GameBuster is a mock e-commerce web application built using *React with Hooks* on the front end and *Ruby on Rails* on the back end. Inspired but a combination of BlockBuster and Gamefly, Gamebuster gives users the chance to browse a variety of games for rent.

## Description

As user will be able to log into their account, bringing them to a home page where they can search for games by title. Users will also be able to filter games using the predetermined filter options available on the home screen.

Users can then see details of the game within each Game card using the built in scroll option, and choose to view the details of that game if they so choose.

From the Game's page, users can add the game to their cart of a selected rental duration if they so choose, as well as leave a review of the game.

When viewing their cart, users will have the ability to not only view what items are in their current cart, but also the items that they have rented in the past.

The final feature alloows for users to 'add' to their wallet. If they attempt to checkout with a cart that has a higher value than their current wallet, they can simply scroll to the top of the page in order to add to the value of their wallet. Giving them the capability of checking out their current cart.

> GameBuster is currently no longer in development. However, further development is not out of the question.

## Installation

1. Start by cloning the overall project repository.
2. Change directories `cd phase4projfrontend` into the front end React application. Assuming that you have used NPM before run the command `npm install` from your command line. Once NPM installation has completed, run the command `npm start` to start the server and open the application in your browser window.
3. Next, cd back to the top level directory and `cd phase4project` into the back end Ruby on Rails application. Once in that directory run `rails s -p 4000` to start the back end server.
4. Once both servers are up and running, in your internet broswer all you have to do is sign into the current user account. *Username: EnriqueKim - password: 123* Once you are logged in, enjoy exploring the fun that is GameBuster.

> The backend server does not necessarily need to be on port 4000. Any other port besides 3000 will suffice. The NPM server runs on localhost:3000.
